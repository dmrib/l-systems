# l-systems
Rendering fractals defined as L-systems ðŸ•¸

### About

This is a simple implementation of a [L-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) renderer.

Given a ruleset, it will derive axioms and render instructions using a Turtle drawer.

Made when I was reading [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/).

### How to run

Simply run a HTTP server on the repository root.

Or se it live [here](https://dmrib.github.io/l-systems/).
